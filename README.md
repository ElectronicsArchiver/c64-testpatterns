# c64-testpatterns

A disk image with a simple basic program that uses redefined characters to create 1x1 checkerboard and 1x1 stripe pattern on the C64. This is used to test for Chroma/Luma artifacts. This will create problems on both NTSC and PAL machines if you do not have proper filtering on the RF modulator. See my YouTube channel for a video on this.
